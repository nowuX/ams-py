# auto-mc-server.py

**[ALPHA]** My own script writing in python that makes it easier for me to set up minecraft servers, my english is bad
btw.

### Usage

On Windows the color support requires: `Computer\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Console => VirtualTerminalLevel` set to 1.
If you don't agree, you can disable the function that modifies it. To disable the ANSI color support in windows change
the `color_support=True` line to `False`

```shell
# Download the latest version of the script
$ curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nowuX/auto-mc-server.py/main/auto_mc_server.py -o auto_mc_server.py

# Put the file in the folder you want to use
$ python auto_mc_server.py
```

Not tested enough, may contain bugs.
